Preparation {

     Cherry jelly

Mix together sugar #1 and pectin.
Warm up pulp and water, at about 50ºC and
sprinkle in, by stirring consistently the pectin and
sugar mixture.
Bring to the boil and add in sugar #2 and
glucose.
Bring back to the boil again for 30 seconds, last
stir in Citric acid 1:1.
Let it cool down.  


     Cherry Ganache

If the chocolates are in blocks or bars, chop
them on a chopping board in small pieces
(about 0.5cm thick). Warm them up in the
microwave to almost half melt stage, pure the
glucose on top and set aside.
Bring almost to the boil cherry puree and
cream. Pour the hot mixture in to the
chopped chocolates with the glucose, in three
steps, stirring with a plastic spatula. Using
stick blender emulsifier the mixture, avoiding
air bubbles to form. When the ganache turns
smooth and shiny, add the butter, alcohol and
continue blending until the mixture turns
again smooth and shiny. Cover with a plastic
wrap, pushing the plastic against the surface
of the mixture and use it to fill the pralines
when the temperature of the ganache is
below 28°C.
